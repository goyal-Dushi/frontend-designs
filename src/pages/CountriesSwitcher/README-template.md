## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project was a refresher of basics for me and I thoroughly enjoyed the process of creating it!

### Continued development

I think I want to improvise my clean code writing capabilities and structuring the project. Alongwith it , I will try using comments whereever required since it helps others understand things better!

- I would rather have found it more interesting if the API would have pagination build in! Looking forward to understanding and working concepts like `Pagination` and `Intersection Observer`

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me understand few css and js concepts.
